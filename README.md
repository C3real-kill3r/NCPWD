# NCPWD

NCPWD is an app that seeks to create an enabling environment for persons with disability to operate effectively and efficiently.

## Problem Statement

The National Council of People Living with Disabilities (NCPWD), is a corporation mandated to formulate and implement policies that are geared towards mainstreaming Persons with disabilities into the national economy.

In line with the councils objectives, the council carries out various activities which heavily relies on interaction with people with disabilities.

## Proposed flow of information

The application will be divided into two platforms, android and web. The web application will be used by the administrators to convey messages and view statistics to help in critical decision making. The android application(android version 4.0+) will be used by the PWD to engage with one another and also receive regular updates from the administrators.

Data will be updated by the council through the web application that will sync with the mobile application as well as the data currently held in the council databases.

## Objectives of the application

### To Public

1. Showcase ongoing and past event activies that the council has engaged in.
2. Enhance awareness and social networking among PWD's through the custom made android app.
3. Allow tailored messages to reach specific people as will be required by the council in carrying out their mandate.
4. Notify PWD's if they have upcoming functions in their area through location based profiling.

### To Administrators

1. Provide detailed tailored information about persons with disabilities.
2. Allow viewing summary data on people registered with disabilities on the go.
3. Allow sending tailored push notifications and message to PWD's

## Advantages of the platform to PWDs

1. They would be abled to get tailored data directly to their phones. The data could range from their registration details, upcoming assesments or events coming close to them.

2. The android app will have provide a social avenue allowing them to be in contact with each other. This will increase social awareness and networking among PWDs.

3. The mobile app would increase visibility of NCPWD. It would be easier to engage with persons with disabilities on the go through push notifications directly to their phones.

4. Most importantly they'll be able to receive information on the go. This would ensure unfettered access to information and streamlined flow of information to the PWDs
